# Camera Calibration

Camera calibration helps to undistort the images.

OpenCV has a [full documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html) on this process.

After running it multiple times for multiple cameras, I found that the results are more or less the same when you have the same camera.

TODO:
Anything which uses yaml should old and depricated--once you find the distortion matrix, save it under `app/utils/constants/constants.py`.
This folder is pretty old and needs to be updated. (1/30/22)
